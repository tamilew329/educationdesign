  <p>Our classrooms were forced online in 2020. Schools and universities across the globe scrambled to update their technology and their courses. While many institutions simply adopted video conferencing to substitute for in-person lectures. Other institutions began to leverage extended reality and virtual environments to keep their participants in learning communities and mitigate feelings of isolation.
      
  </p>
  <p class="emphasis">Virtual Reality and Virtual worlds are environments where participants are immersed while still present with fellow learners. At the same time, the flexibility of coming and meeting at one's own convenience and the constant availability of resources and materials makes virtual spaces attractive for educational purposes.
